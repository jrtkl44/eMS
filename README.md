Local Setup Instructions:

Make sure MySQL and Apache2 are running on your system.

Create a new MySQL database named eMS.

Place Project Files:
Windows: Put the eMS folder inside the htdocs directory (usually in XAMPP).
Linux / Mac: Place the folder in your web server’s root directory (/var/www/html/ for Linux, etc.).


Open all the project files in your preferred code editor.

Configure Database Connection:
Open db.php and update the MySQL password.
If you haven’t set a password, leave it blank.


Once configured, you can open the website by navigating to http://localhost/eMS in your browser.
